### Famous logos recreated with step-by-step CSS animation

![CSS Pen](public/thumbs/netflix.png)

In **CSS Pen**, each figure is **drawn with CSS** and gradually takes shape, evolving step by step. From logos to iconic shapes, every design is carefully crafted to show **how it comes together visually** through structured styling.

At first glance, it's a gallery of minimalist illustrations. But there's more: you can **enable the code view**, follow its evolution step by step, and even **edit it** to see what happens if you change something. An artistic, educational, and experimental experience, all at once.

There's also a **back office** where new figures can be created from scratch, customizing each step in real time. While not open to the public yet, it lays the foundation for future contributions and expansion. Additionally, when you share a figure, the URL includes a **preview of the image**, allowing others to see it before opening the link.
